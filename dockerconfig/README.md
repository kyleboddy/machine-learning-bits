## Sample Programs in Python, R, and PHP for Environment Testing

Below are sample programs demonstrating basic data science tasks in Python, R, and PHP. These examples are designed to test the environment setup and showcase some of the capabilities provided by the installed packages.

### Python Example: Basic Data Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate some data
x = np.arange(0., 5., 0.2)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a simple line plot
plt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Sin(x)')
plt.title('Simple Line Plot in Python')
plt.xlabel('X axis')
plt.ylabel('Y axis')
plt.legend()

# Save the figure
plt.savefig('python_plot.png')
```

This Python script generates a line plot of the sine function and saves it as 'python_plot.png' in the '/workspace' directory.

### R Example: Data Manipulation with dplyr

``` R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eva'),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45),
  Score = c(85, 90, 88, 95, 80)
)

# Use dplyr to filter and summarize data
result <- df %>%
  filter(Age > 30) %>%
  summarise(AverageScore = mean(Score))

# Print the result
print(result)

# Generate a plot
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Name, y=Score, fill=Name)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Scores by Name", y="Score")

# Save the plot to a file
ggsave("r_plot.png", plot=p)

# Check if running in a Jupyter notebook and display inline if so
if (interactive()) {
  print(p)
} else {
  cat("Plot saved to r_plot.png\n")
}
```

The R script begins by filtering a data frame to include only individuals over 30 years old and calculates the average score among them. Additionally, it utilizes ggplot2 to generate a bar plot visualizing the scores for each individual in the data frame. The plot is saved to r_plot.png in the current directory.

If the script is executed in a Jupyter notebook, the plot will be displayed inline; otherwise, a message indicating the plot's save location is printed.

### PHP Example: Simple Data Processing and JSON Encoding

``` php
<?php

// Create an associative array
$data = array(
  "name" => "John Doe",
  "age" => 30,
  "scores" => array(70, 80, 90)
);

// Calculate the average score
$averageScore = array_sum($data["scores"]) / count($data["scores"]);
$data["averageScore"] = $averageScore;

// Set image dimensions and bar dimensions
$width = 200;
$height = 100;
$barWidth = 20;

// Create the image
$image = imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height);

// Allocate colors
$background = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 255, 255);
$border = imagecolorallocate($image, 0, 0, 0);
$barColor = imagecolorallocate($image, 0, 0, 255);

// Fill background and draw border
imagefill($image, 0, 0, $background);
imagerectangle($image, 0, 0, $width-1, $height-1, $border);

// Draw bars
foreach ($data["scores"] as $key => $value) {
    imagefilledrectangle($image, ($key * $barWidth * 2) + 10, $height - ($value / 100 * $height), 
        ($key * $barWidth * 2) + 10 + $barWidth, $height - 1, $barColor);
}

// Save the image to a file
imagepng($image, "php_chart.png");
imagedestroy($image);

echo "Chart saved to php_chart.png\n";

```

This enhanced PHP script begins by creating an associative array to hold a person's name, age, and an array of scores. It calculates the average score and adds it to the array. Then, using the php-gd library, it generates a bar chart visualizing the individual scores and saves this chart as an image (php_chart.png) in the current directory.

The script demonstrates a simple but powerful way to visualize data in a PHP environment, particularly useful in scenarios where PHP is used for server-side data processing.

## Python Advanced Example Program

And finally, here's a more advanced Python program to test out with an explanation to follow:

``` Python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
feature_names = iris.feature_names
target_names = iris.target_names

# Convert to Pandas DataFrame for more complex manipulations
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names)
df['target'] = y

# Explore the dataset (simple example: compute Pearson correlation coefficients between features)
for i in range(len(feature_names)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(feature_names)):
        corr, _ = pearsonr(df[feature_names[i]], df[feature_names[j]])
        print(f"Pearson Correlation between {feature_names[i]} and {feature_names[j]}: {corr:.3f}")

# Data Preprocessing
## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

## Feature Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Feature Extraction with PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_train_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_train_scaled)
X_test_pca = pca.transform(X_test_scaled)

# Model Training
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_pca, y_train)

# Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_pca)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=target_names))
```

## Advanced Python Program Explanation

### Data Loading
The program begins by loading the Iris dataset using `Scikit-learn`. This dataset includes 150 samples of iris flowers with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target variable indicating the iris species.

### Data Exploration
It computes and prints the Pearson correlation coefficients between each pair of features using `SciPy`, demonstrating a simple data exploration technique.

### Data Preprocessing
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- `StandardScaler` is applied to scale features, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for feature extraction, reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance.

### Model Training
A `RandomForestClassifier` is trained on the PCA-transformed and scaled training data.

### Model Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test set, and the classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, is printed.

This program covers various aspects of a typical machine learning workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation, making it a solid example of using advanced data science tools in Python.
